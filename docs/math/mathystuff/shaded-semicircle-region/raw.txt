question:

A semicircle with a diameter of 4 sits on top of a square.
Point P is at the center of the arc.
What is the area of the shaded region?

choices:
pi + 2
pi/2 + 2
2pi + 2
2pi - 4
2pi + 4

dialogue:

When you encounter a difficult geometry question, try everything.

But I don't know what to try.
Maybe I can stare at it, and I'll think of something.

Staring doesnt work. You have to move your hands.

Move my hands ... like the macerena dance?
::macarena.typ::

Move your hands by writing things down. For example, you can find the area of the square.

The area of the square is 4 * 4 = 16. But what does that do?

You can also find the area of the semicircle.

Can I?

::equations.circleArea::
    center = true

flex
    The diameter of the circle is 4.
    the radius is 2. 
    The area is ::compute(2)::.

    ::circle-a::

flex
    And then cut it in half because it is a semicircle.
    ::semicircle-a::

flex

So 2pi. But this still doesnt help us find the shaded region.

We now know the area of the whole thing!

But $, that still isnt even close to the shaded area.

Now, the secret ingredient for hard geometry questions. Are you ready $?

I am.

You have to draw a line.

Draw a line?

Yes.

But where?

Anywhere.

ANYWHERE?

If you draw the right line, you will know.

Are any of these lines correct?

Diagram #38. 

Why?

Reason 1: Symmetry

Reason 2: It forms a triangle

I can find the area of this triangle!

the base is the same as the radius which is 2.
the height, well it's a square, so it's still 4.

bh/2 -> 2 * 4 / 2 = 4. The triangle is 4.

Also, the whole thing is 16 + 2pi. That's what we found earlier.
That means half of the shape will be 8 + pi.
The triangle is 6.

subtracting the triangle away from the half, the shaded area is 8 + 2pi - 6 = 4 + 2pi.

The answer is (K)!

Great Work !

For how /home/kdog3682/many integers of n will $n - 10 / 14 - n$ have a positive value?

Try the number 6.


$6 - 10 / 14 - 6 => -4/8$

The numerator is negative so no.

Is 0 a positive number?

Zero is neither positive nor negative.

$100 - 10 / 14 - 100$

$5 - 10 / 14 - 5$

$n - 10 / 14 - n$


The ratio of $a$ to $b$ is 3 to 4.
The ratio of $b$ to $c$ is 5 to 6.

A bag of beans

Sam has a jar of red, green, and blue jelly beans.
12 of them are red, 25% are green, and the rest are blue.

There is a 1 in 3 chance of randomly picking a red jelly bean.

How /home/kdog3682/many jelly beans are blue?

How do we do this question $?

It's a probability question $.
The key is to find the total.
~
Then we can do $part / total$.

but we dont know the total
