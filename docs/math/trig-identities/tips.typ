[Is there a trick you use when solving difficult trig proofs?]

No ... not really.


[What goes in your head when going about these (hard) situations?]

When I know the answer, I can usually do it immediately.

But for hard ones where I don't know what to do, I feel stuck. 
My brain feels blank, and it feels super frustrating.


[Do you have an idea of where you want to see your end product?}

Usually I dont. I just try different things and see if anything works.
    

Have you ever tried using flashcards for studying? Every time you come across a hard question on your homework, turn it into a flashcard. After awhile, you will have an army of difficult questions in your flashcards.


Here is how you could organize them:

- Card Type 1: Memorizations (label = remember)
    
    On the front, put the thing you want to memorize. 
        Maybe its a strategy.
        Maybe its a trick.
        Maybe it something useful.

    On the back, write a question that this memorization is useful for.

- Card Type 2: Hard Questions (label = question)

        On the front, write the question.
        On the back, write the steps that will help you solve it.


Hope this is a little bit helpful.
